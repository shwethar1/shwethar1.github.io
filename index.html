							<h2>Interactive Neurorehabillitation Lab at Virginia Tech</h2>
							<p>I am a huge HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) nerd because it is basically the love child of Psychology and Computer Science! I recently started as a part-time undergraduate research
                 intern under Dr. Kelliher. Her research at the rehabillitation lab involves implementing an in-home therapy model to help improve hand-eye coordination among stroke patients. I assist the user experience design team with designing the task interface,
                  psychological analysis of optimal patient performence, visualization with
stakeholder groups, and contributing to the design of the movement capture and
annotation interfaces using machine learning. </p>

							<h2>React Chat App</h2>
							<p>This fictitious React JS Chat Engine App is developed for the residents and interns of Seattle Grace Hospital from the popular Netflix show "Grey's Anatomy". The Grey's anatomy cast finds their way through their tough residency program by forming relationships, friendships, and scrubbing in on surgeries together. This app models potential conversations the interns and residents could be chatting about. This app features online status updates, real time response, read reciept functionality, ability to create new chat groups, text/attatchment/image support, and the ability to add new users through chatengine.io</p>Check out my project!</p>

							<h2>Planning Poker Web App</h2>
							<p>Planning poker is a consensus-based gamified technique, used for estimating project size, goals, and effort required in the software development. It is popularly used in a framework called Scrum. A couple intern buddies and I decided to do a planning poker web app so that employees could do virtual estimation. We used Node JS for the framework, Express for the server, as well as socket.io for the websocket framework. </p>

							<h2>Interactive Neurorehabillitation Lab at Virginia Tech</h2>
							<p>I am a huge HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) nerd because it is basically the love child of Psychology and Computer Science! I recently started as a part-time undergraduate research
                 intern under Dr. Kelliher. Her research at the rehabillitation lab involves implementing an in-home therapy model to help improve hand-eye coordination among stroke patients. I assist the user experience design team with designing the task interface,
                  psychological analysis of optimal patient performence, visualization with
stakeholder groups, and contributing to the design of the movement capture and
annotation interfaces using machine learning. </p>
